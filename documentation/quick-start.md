# Quick Start

Set up your React Native development [environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). Follow instructions for **React Native Cli**.

Clone this repo, and remove the `.git` folder from the project root.

Rename the project using the [Rect Native Rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename) library. For example, run this command in the **Starter** directory:  

```npx react-native-rename "New App" -b com.coreplan.newapp```

Run ```yarn install```, then in the *ios* folder, ```pod install```. Check the **Note for Mac M1 users** on the [React Native Getting started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) if you're on an M1 mac and have problems.  

Run ```yarn ios``` or ```yarn android``` to get started.  

Check out the [Commands](commands.md) document to see what other commands are available, build, lint, etc.

This repo is configured to use the [Git Flow](git-flow.md) branching model.
